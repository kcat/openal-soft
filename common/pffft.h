/* PFFFT : a Pretty Fast FFT.
 *
 * This is basically an adaptation of the single precision fftpack (v4) as
 * found on netlib taking advantage of SIMD instructions found on CPUs such as
 * Intel x86 (SSE1), PowerPC (Altivec), and Arm (NEON).
 *
 * For architectures where SIMD instructions aren't available, the code falls
 * back to a scalar version.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 *
 * - 1D transforms only, with 32-bit single precision.
 *
 * - supports only transforms for inputs of length N of the form
 * N=(2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c), given a >= 5, b >=0, c >= 0 (32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 144,
 * 160, etc are all acceptable lengths). Performance is best for 128<=N<=8192.
 *
 * - all (float*) pointers for the functions below are expected to have a
 * "SIMD-compatible" alignment, that is 16 bytes.
 *
 * You can allocate such buffers with the pffft_aligned_malloc function, and
 * deallocate them with pffft_aligned_free (or with stuff like posix_memalign,
 * aligned_alloc, etc).
 *
 * Note that for the z-domain data of real transforms, when in the canonical
 * order (as interleaved complex numbers) both 0-frequency and half-frequency
 * components, which are real, are assembled in the first entry as
 * F(0)+i*F(n/2+1). The original fftpack placed F(n/2+1) at the end of the
 * arrays instead.
