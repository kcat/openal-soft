    Changed the context error state to be thread-local. This is technically out
    of spec, but necessary to avoid race conditions with multi-threaded use.

    Split the cubic resampler into 4-point spline and gaussian variants. The
    latter prioritizing the suppression of aliasing distortion and harmonics,
    the former not reducing high frequencies as much.

    Improved ring modulator quality.

    Improved performance of convolution reverb.

    Improved WASAPI device enumeration performance.

    Added UWP support.

    used.

    high pitch shifts when using a bsinc resampler.

    Added a PipeWire backend.

    Added enumeration for the JACK and CoreAudio backends.

    Added optional support for RTKit to get real-time priority. Only used as a
    backup when pthread_setschedparam fails.

    Added an option for JACK playback to render directly in the real-time
    processing callback. For lower playback latency, on by default.

    Added an option for custom JACK devices.

    the .amb format, and are encoded from libsndfile-compatible formats.

    device disconnects. Allows devices to be reset or reopened and have sources
    resume from where they left off.

    Lowered the priority of the JACK backend. To avoid it getting picked when
    PipeWire is providing JACK compatibility, since the JACK backend is less
    robust with auto-configuration.

    in libopenal.

    Added an option for auto-connecting JACK ports.

    Added greater-than-stereo support to the SoundIO backend.

    Modified the mixer to be fully asynchronous with the external API, and
    should now be real-time safe. Although alcRenderSamplesSOFT is not due to
    locking to check the device handle validity.

    Modified the UHJ encoder to use an all-pass FIR filter that's less harmful
    to non-filtered signal phase.

    Converted examples from SDL_sound to libsndfile. To avoid issues when
    combining SDL2 and SDL_sound.

    Worked around a 32-bit GCC/MinGW bug with TLS destructors. See:
    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=83562
