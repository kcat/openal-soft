#### alGenSources
##### Description
This function generates one or more sources.   References to sources are
`ALuint` values, which are used wherever a source reference is needed (in calls
such as [alDeleteSources](#aldeletesources) and [alSourcei](#alsourcei)).

```cpp
void alGenSources(
    ALsizei n,
    ALuint *sources
);
```

##### Parameters
* n - The number of sources to be generated
* sources - Pointer to an array of `ALuint` vlaues which will store the names of
            the new sources

##### Possible Error States
| State                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY     | There is not enough memory to generate all the requested sources. |
| AL_INVALID_VALUE     | There are not enough non-memory resources to create all the requested sources, or the array pointer is not valid. |
| AL_INVALID_OPERATION | There is no context to create sources in. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
If the requested number of sources cannot be created, an error will be generated
which can be detected with [alGetError](error.md#algeterror).  If an error
occurs, no sources will be generated.  If `n` equals zero,
[alGenSources](#algensources) does nothing and does not return an error.

#### alSourceQueueBuffers
##### Description
This function queues a set of buffers on a source.  All buffers attached to a
source will be played in sequence, and the number of processed buffers can be
detected using an [alSourcei](#alsourcei) call to retrieve
`AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED`.

```cpp
void alSourceQueueBuffers(
    ALuint source,
	ALsizei n,
	ALuint* buffers
);
```

##### Parameters
* source - The name of the source to queue buffers onto
* n - The number of buffers to be queued
* buffers - A pointer to an array of buffer names to be queued

##### Possible Error States
| State                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| AL_INVALID_NAME      | At least one specified buffer name is not valid, or the specified source name is not valid. |
| AL_INVALID_OPERATION | There is no current context, an attempt was made to add a new buffer which is not the same format as the buffers already in the queue, or the source already has a static buffer attached. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
When first created, a source will be of type `AL_UNDETERMINED`.  A successful
[alSourceQueueBuffers](#alsourcequeuebuffers) call will change the source type
to `AL_STREAMING`.

[alSourceUnqueueBuffers](#alsourceunqueuebuffers)

#### alSourceUnqueueBuffers
##### Description
This function unqueues a set of buffers attached to a source.  The number of
processed buffers can be detected using an [alSourcei](#alsourcei) call to
retrieve `AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED`, which is the maximum number of buffers that can
be unqueued using this call.

```cpp
void alSourceUnqueueBuffers(
    ALuint source,
	ALsizei n,
	ALuint* buffers
);
```

##### Parameters
* source - The name of the source to unqueue buffers from
* n - The number of buffers to be unqueued
* buffers - A pointer to an array of buffer names that were removed

##### Possible Error States
| State                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| AL_INVALID_VALUE     | At least one buffer can not be unqueued because it has not been processed yet. |
| AL_INVALID_NAME      | The specified source name is not valid. |
| AL_INVALID_OPERATION | There is no current context. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
The unqueue operation will only take place if all n buffers can be removed from
the queue.
