#### alGenBuffers
##### Description
This function generates one or more buffers, which contain audio data (see
[alBufferData](#albufferdata)).  References to buffers are `ALuint` values,
which are used wherever a buffer reference is needed (in calls such as
[alDeleteBuffers](#aldeletebuffers), [alSourcei](source.md#alsourcei),
[alSourceQueueBuffers](source.md#alsourcequeuebuffers), and
[alSourceUnqueueBuffers](source.md#alsourceunqueuebuffers)).

```cpp
void alGenBuffers(
    ALsizei n,
    ALuint *buffers
);
```

##### Parameters
* n - The number of buffers to be generated
* buffers - Pointer to an array of ALuint values which will store the names of
            the new buffers

##### Possible Error States
| State            | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| AL_INVALID_VALUE | The buffer array isn't large enough to hold the number of buffers requested. |
| AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY | There is not enough memory available to generate all the buffers requested. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
If the requested number of buffers cannot be created, an error will be generated
which can be detected with [alGetError](error.md#algeterror).  If an error
occurs, no buffers will be generated.  If `n` equals zero,
[alGenBuffers](#algenbuffers) does nothing and does not return an error.

##### See Also
[alDeleteBuffers](#aldeletebuffers), [alIsBuffer](#alisbuffer)

#### alDeleteBuffers
##### Description
This function deletes one or more buffers, freeing the resources used by the
buffer.  Buffers which are attached to a source can not be deleted.  See
[alSourcei](source.md#alsourcei) and
[alSourceUnqueueBuffers](source.md#alsourceunqueuebuffers) for information on
how to detach a buffer from a source.

```cpp
void alDeleteBuffers(
    ALsizei n,
    ALuint *buffers
);
```

##### Parameters
* n - The number of buffers to be deleted
* buffers - Pointer to an array of buffer names identifying the buffers to be
            deleted

##### Possible Error States
| State                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| AL_INVALID_OPERATION | The buffer is still in use and can not be deleted. |
| AL_INVALID_NAME      | A buffer name is invalid. |
| AL_INVALID_VALUE     | The requested number of buffers can not be deleted. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
If the requested number of buffers cannot be deleted, an error will be generated
which can be detected with [alGetError](error.md#algeterror).  If an error
occurs, no buffers will be deleted.  If `n` equals zero,
[alDeleteBuffers](#alDeleteBuffers) does nothing and will not return an error.

##### See Also
[alGenBuffers](#alGenBuffers), [alIsBuffer](#alIsBuffer)

#### alIsBuffer
##### Description
This function tests if a buffer name is valid, returning `AL_TRUE` if valid,
`AL_FALSE` if not.

```cpp
ALboolean alIsBuffer(
    ALuint buffer
);
```

##### Parameters
* buffer - A buffer name to be tested for validity

##### Possible Error States
None

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
The `NULL` buffer is always valid (see [alSourcei](source.md#alsourcei) for
information on how the NULL `buffer` is used).

##### See Also
[alGenBuffers](#alGenBuffers), [alDeleteBuffers](#aldeletebuffers)

#### alBufferData
##### Description
This function fills a buffer with audio data.  All the pre-defined formats are
PCM data, but this function may be used by extensions to load other data types
as well.

```cpp
void alBufferData(
    ALuint buffer,
    ALenum format,
    const ALvoid *data,
    ALsizei size,
    ALsizei freq
);
```

##### Parameters
* buffer - Buffer name to be filled with data
* format - Format type from among the following:
    + `AL_FORMAT_MONO8`
	+ `AL_FORMAT_MONO16`
	+ `AL_FORMAT_STEREO8`
	+ `AL_FORMAT_STEREO16`
* data - Pointer to the audio data
* size - The size of the data in bytes
* freq - The frequency of the audio data

##### Possible Error States
| State            | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY | There is not enough memory available to create this buffer. |
| AL_INVALID_VALUE | The size parameter is not valid for the format specified, the buffer is in use, or the data is a `NULL` pointer. |
| AL_INVALID_ENUM  | The specified format does not exist. |

##### Version Requirements
OpenAL 1.0 or higher

##### Remarks
8-bit PCM data is expressed as an unsigned value over the range 0 to 255, 128
being an audio output level of zero.  16-bit PCM data is expressed as a signed
value over the range -32768 to 32767, 0 being an audio output level of zero.
Stereo data is expressed in interleaved format, left channel first.  Buffers
containing more than one channel of data will be played without 3D
spatialization.
